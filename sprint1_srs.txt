1. Introduction


1.1 Purpose

		The purpose of this SRS document is to describe the requirements
	specification for a microservice that generates plausible aspects of a 
	persons' life based on input data.

1.2	General Description
	
		Given input data from Craigslist, the Life Generator will formulate 
	conclusions about aspects of a persons' life (e.g., their job description,
	their home, their vehicle, items they rent or own, etc.).

1.3 Scope

		This document serves only to generate plausible aspects of a person's 
	life. This document does not attempt, in any away, to collect specific 
	information about a person using the input data. When data is used, it will
	be assigned a subject number to produce speculations about a person's life,
	not facts.


2. Requirements


2.1	Functional Requirements

	- As a developer, I will need to provide an API so that other users can
	  access the microservice.

	- As a developer, I will need to have access to external APIs to gather
	  information to use within the microservice.

	- As a user, I will need to view information about a subject through a user
	  interface. 

	- As a client, I will need access to the raw data. 

	- As a developer, I will need to create the database to store subject
	  data.

2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

	- The microservice API that is created should be agnostic to the language
	  being used to access it. The API should return data the can be interpreted
	  however the end-user chooses. 
	
		Quality Attributes: Accessibility, Interoperability

	- The user-interface of the microservice will be simple and intuitive. The
	  user should not have to guess about what to steps to perform.

		Quality Attribute: Memorability

	- The microservice should produce results about plausible aspects of a 
	  subject's life in under 10 seconds. During this duration, the user should
	  be given feedback about where the software is at in the process.

	- The database and microservice will active >99% of the time.

		Quality Atttribute: Integrity
