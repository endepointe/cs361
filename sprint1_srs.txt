1. Introduction


1.1 Purpose

		The purpose of this SRS document is to describe the requirements
	specification for a microservice that generates plausible aspects of a 
	persons' life based on input data.

1.2	General Description
	
		Given input data from Craigslist, the Life Generator will formulate 
	conclusions about aspects of a persons' life (e.g., their job description,
	their home, their vehicle, items they rent or own, etc.).

1.3 Scope

		This document serves only to generate plausible aspects of a person's 
	life. This document does not attempt, in any away, to collect specific 
	information about a person using the input data. When data is used, it will
	be assigned a subject number to produce speculations about a person's life,
	not facts.
